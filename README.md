Sentinel ATT&CK aims to simplify the rapid deployment of a threat hunting capability that leverages Sysmon and [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) on Azure Sentinel.

**DISCLAIMER:** This tool requires tuning and investigative trialling to be truly effective in a production environment.

### Overview
 Sentinel ATT&CK provides the following set of tools: 
 - A [Sysmon configuration file](https://github.com/BlueTeamToolkit/sentinel-attack/blob/master/sysmonconfig.xml) compatible with Azure Sentinel and mapped to specific ATT&CK techniques  
 - A [Sysmon log parser](https://github.com/BlueTeamToolkit/sentinel-attack/blob/master/parser/Sysmon-OSSEM.txt) mapped against the [OSSEM](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM) data model
 - 117 ready-to-use Kusto [detection rules](https://github.com/BlueTeamToolkit/sentinel-attack/tree/master/detections) covering 156 ATT&CK techniques
 - A [Sysmon threat hunting workbook](https://github.com/BlueTeamToolkit/sentinel-attack/tree/master/hunting) inspired by the [Threat Hunting App](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4305/) for Splunk to help simplify threat hunts
 - A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) script to provision a lab to test Sentinel ATT&CK
 - Comprehensive guidance to help you use the materials in this repository
